Some flights may need to be canceled and re-booked instead of changed, depending on the airline's policy. Additionally, if the option to change your flight is not visible, it could be due to airline rules prohibiting self-serve changes through a third party, or because the flight is still being ticketed. \n\nIf these do not resolve the issue, it may be necessary to explore other technical troubleshooting steps or consider contacting support for further assistance.\nagent: \nuser:  can i cancel my flight with a refund?\nsummary: Based on the user input, the FLIGHT booking is located with booking ID NP9NW5]",
