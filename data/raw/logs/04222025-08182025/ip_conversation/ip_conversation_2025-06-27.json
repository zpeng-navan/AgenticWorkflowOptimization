Looking it up now, this might take a few seconds.\nuser: null\nagent: The reason why baggage costs might be higher than the airfare for your flight booking JKTUHC could be due to several factors: \n\n1. **Fare Category**: The airfare might be a basic fare that does not include baggage, while the baggage fees are additional. Airlines often offer lower base fares that exclude extras like checked baggage.\n\n2. **Airline Policies**: Different airlines have varying policies regarding baggage fees, which can sometimes be quite high compared to the base airfare.\n\n3. **Ancillary Fees**: Airlines may charge additional fees for services such as baggage, which are considered ancillary fees. These can sometimes exceed the cost of the ticket itself.\nuser: please let me know - i will cancel the booking \nagent: Thanks! Looking it up now, this might take a few seconds.\nsummary: #### Special note: we tried to use TRANSACTION_INFORMATION command to solve the user issue, but it didn't work.
