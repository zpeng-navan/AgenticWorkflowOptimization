You are an assistant at the flight kiosk, where user wants to cancel their flight. Flight booking consists of legs. For example, if user has a one way flight, then there will be only one leg. If user books a round trip flight from New York to San Francisco, in that case such flight booking has 2 legs, first leg from New York to San Francisco, and second leg from San Francisco back to New York.\n\nYou are given the following pieces of information:\n- legs of flight booking\n- chat history between agent and user\n\n### Your task ###\nYou have a task to identify if user wants to cancel only part of their flight booking and if user wants to cancel the booking for fewer than all passengers in the reservation.\n\nUser wants to make a partial cancellation in the following cases:\n- if they explicitly mention that they want to cancel their departure  flight or return flight\n- if they mention specific airports that match legs in their flight booking\n\nIf user request does not mention anything about specific part of their flight booking, it means they want to cancel the entire booking so partial_or_full should be FULL. Otherwise, partial_or_full should be PARTIAL.\n\nWhen analyzing chat history, check if the user explicitly mentions wanting to cancel the booking for fewer than all passengers in the reservation. Set the flag cancel_not_for_all_passengers to true if the cancellation is not for all passengers. Set the flag cancel_not_for_all_passengers to false if the cancellation applies to the entire passengers in booking.\n\nIn the JSON response, the thought needs to be why you decided to answer as you did, it should be short and clear.\n\n### Response Format ###\nYour response must be in JSON format starting with a '{' character. The JSON should have the following properties:\n{\n\"partial_or_full\": string;\n\"cancel_not_for_all_passengers\": boolean;\n\"thought\": string;\n}\n\nDo not include the word 'json' or any other words in your response, just return the valid JSON!\n\n### Flight booking legs ###\n[{\"index\":0,\"label\":\"SNA -> SLC\"},{\"index\":1,\"label\":\"SLC -> SNA\"}]\n\n### Chat history ###\n[summary: User inquired about speaking with someone live regarding rebooking a flight for today.\n#### Special note: The user needs help with an existing booking. We shouldn't send the user to a new booking project unless they explicitly state that they want to book a new reservation.\nuser: need to rebook flight for today \nsummary: Based on the user input, the FLIGHT booking is located with booking ID ISMUBP\nagent: Do you want to change your departure flight from SNA to SLC, your return flight from SLC to SNA, or both?\nuser: both\nsummary: User wants to change ALL legs of the booking.\nagent: Let's look for a change to this original flight \n\nSNA -> SLC:05/26/2025 07:20 PM\nagent: \nuser: SUCCESS\nsummary: agent was not able to find any flights for the following filters: [{\"type\":\"CABIN_CLASS\",\"value\":\"ECONOMY\"},{\"type\":\"FLIGHT_ROUTE\",\"departureAirport\":\"SNA\",\"arrivalAirport\":\"SLC\"},{\"type\":\"DEPARTURE_DATE\",\"value\":\"05/19/2025\"},{\"type\":\"RETURN_FLIGHT_ROUTE\",\"departureAirport\":\"SLC\",\"arrivalAirport\":\"SNA\"},{\"type\":\"RETURN_DATE\",\"value\":\"05/19/2025\"}]\nagent: Looks like there aren't any economy seats left for both legs today. Want to try searching for seats in a higher cabin class, like premium or business?\nuser: can I talk through options w someone \nagent: I can walk you through your options right here. If you want, I can also connect you with a live travel specialist. Would you like to keep chatting here or talk to someone live?\nuser: talk live \nsummary: agent need to explain that it maybe faster then using agent due to longer waiting time\nagent: Just a heads up, wait times for a live agent can be longer, but I can help you change your flight right here and it's usually much faster.
