Looking it up now, this might take a few seconds.\nagent: The discrepancy in flight availability between Navan and the American Airlines website can occur because Navan's inventory reflects the latest information available from the airline, but real-time changes in availability and prices can happen as people book, cancel, or modify their flights. This means that a flight might appear available on the airline's website but not on Navan due to these real-time updates.\n\nTo proceed with changing your return flight, you can try using the self-serve flight change tool in Navan.
