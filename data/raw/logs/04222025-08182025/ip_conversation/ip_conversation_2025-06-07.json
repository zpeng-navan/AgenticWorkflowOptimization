Otherwise, partial_or_full should be PARTIAL.\n\nWhen analyzing chat history, check if the user explicitly mentions wanting to cancel the booking for fewer than all passengers in the reservation. Set the flag cancel_not_for_all_passengers to true if the cancellation is not for all passengers. Set the flag cancel_not_for_all_passengers to false if the cancellation applies to the entire passengers in booking.\n\nIn the JSON response, the thought needs to be why you decided to answer as you did, it should be short and clear.\n\n### Response Format ###\nYour response must be in JSON format starting with a '{' character.
