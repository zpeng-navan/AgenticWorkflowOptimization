Looking it up now, this might take a few seconds.\nagent: It is not possible to transfer your flight booking to a colleague so that they can use your ticket instead. Flight tickets are generally non-transferable due to airline policies.\nuser: my flights are non refundable - how is this possible\nagent: Thanks! Looking it up now, this might take a few seconds.\nagent: The reasoning behind non-refundable and non-transferable flights generally stems from the fare rules set by airlines. These rules are part of the terms and conditions associated with a particular airline ticket, which can include restrictions on changes, cancellations, and usage of the ticket segments. Non-refundable tickets are typically offered at a lower price, providing a cost-saving option for travelers who are certain of their travel plans. The non-transferable aspect ensures that the ticket remains with the original purchaser, which helps airlines manage their inventory and pricing strategies more effectively.\nuser: can i please have a refund for my singapore flights\nsummary: Based on the user input, the FLIGHT booking is located with booking ID 1783756\nagent: Just to confirm, would you like to cancel your Singapore flights, or are you specifically requesting a refund without canceling the booking?\nuser: i'm requesting to cancel and refund the flights]",
