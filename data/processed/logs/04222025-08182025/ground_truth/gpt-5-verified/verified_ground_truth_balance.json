What happens is the airline won't allow us to cancel the return as-is. and forces you to exchange the ticket to a one-way instead. However, there's a workaround to this, which is to simply have Michael fly to DCA first, and then we can cancel the return since the outbound portion of the ticket will be marked as 'flown' then, and we can hold it as a partial credit.\nagent: A bit of a hassle but that is definitely the easiest way\nuser: if we cancel the return now wouldn't he also have it as a credit\nagent: No, so what happens is the airline will see he has a ticket that goes from ORD to DCA, and DCA and ORD, but that his itinerary only has ORD to DCA. They won't allow him to board that since the ticket doesn't match the itinerary.\nagent: It sounds really silly but that's how it works with the airlines.\nagent: What they will require is instead a ticket that goes ORD to DCA only, if that's what Michael's intentions to board are.\nuser: if I want his return to be a different destination than ORD can we do that \nagent: Now, here's where it gets confusing: The same problem doesn't happen with American Airlines and Delta. They allow residual credits so that makes the process easier, but United are a little harder to deal with\nagent: Yes, we can do that as well.\nuser: OK, then I don't need to do anything as of right now, thank you!\nagent: Noted!

Can you confirm that as well?\nagent: I do see there will be a credit, would you allow me a few moments to verify if there is any cancellation fee?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Per southwest policy there  will be no cancellation fee. The credit will have an expiration limit of 6 months. We will need to escalate the concern to our support team at this time to split the booking then cancel for Abbey, so as not to interrupt your flights. Can you hold for a few moments while we do that?\nuser: Thanks for confirming, Jordan. Yes, I can wait\nagent: thank you!\nagent: I'm Still working on this and Appreciate your patience\nuser: Okay thanks\nagent: you're welcome\nagent: Hi Mitchell?\nuser: Hello\nagent: We are ready to go ahead with the cancellation, but one of the rules with southwest basic fare is that when you cancel, any rebooking will need to be with a higher fare , and cannot be another basic fare, can we proceed with the change?\nuser: We aren't rebooking though. Just cancelling Abbey's flight. Do you mean we would have to use the flight credit on a higher fare in the future? Or do you mean that I am being rebooked and will have to pay a higher fare for this flight?\nagent: you will need to use the flight credit for Abbey to rebook a higher fare in the future or risk losing the credit\nagent: your flight is protected\nuser: As long as my flight is protected and we are getting a credit back for Abbey then you are good to proceed. \nuser: That seems like a ridiculous rule on their part, though lol\nagent: Yes, sorry, I do see it has changed from the previous way of charging a cancellation fee. and I understand it is inconvenient ,we will keep your flight and upload Abbey's flight credit to her navan personal travel account after 5 business days\nagent: The cancellation is complete. Can I help you with anything else today?\nuser: Thanks. Even though the credit will be uploaded to Abbey's Navan account, would we be able to use it to book directly with Southwest, if need be? For instance, we recently booked with them directly due to a sale that did not appear on Navan. If that happens again can we use her flight credit outside of Navan?\nagent: You can make that request with Southwest directly , and provide the credit number that gets uploaded to the profile\nuser: Understood. Thanks for your help, Jordan\nagent: of course, can I help with something else today?\nuser: Not today, thanks.\nagent: It has been a pleasure assisting you today.

When I went to do this on my own, the only option I saw was to cancel both ways. Would he get a credit for the cancelled outbound flight?\nagent: Let me go ahead and check on that. I am already looking for an option. Please give me a few minutes to check the policy.\nuser: Thanks\nagent: Your most welcome, Mitchell. Kindly give me a few minutes to check this.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, upon checking with United Airlines policy, cancelling the outbound flight and keeping the return is a proces of change. Because a new ticket needs to be issued for the return flight as the ticket that Brian have is currently roundtrip.\nagent: Upon checking there's actually no change fee for changing your flight, however, there will be also no fee in cancelling the outbound now. How would you like to proceed on this?\nuser: Do you mean we need to cancel the roundtrip flight and rebook just the return flight but we can do so for free?\nagent: Yes, that's right.\nuser: Okay. Would you be able to help with that?\nagent: Yes, of course. Do you wish to proceed in cancelling and keeping the return flight?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Perfect! Thank you for that.

Apparently, there's no window seat that is free on the flight from DEN to COS, but the airline will provide a seat once checked in.\nagent: Will there be anything else that I can assist you with?\nuser: Thank you for dong that! And these updates will show up in the Navan trip for Brian to see?\nagent: Yes, you can try checking that through his Navan profile, as the flight has already been updated.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, I also noticed that Brian does have a hotel booking, however upon checking here, the hotel rooms are non-refundable. Any changes that you may want to check will be cancelling this, and rebooking a new one.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, is there anything else you need assistance with?\nuser: No that is all.

I think the agent split the booking which i dont really understand what it means but it was so they could try to look into just adjusting Scott's on its own\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi and the details provided. It does show the agent split the PNRs so that you and Scott were no longer on the same reservation. No cancellation was made at the time, due to a schedule change the airline made, and the consultant was never able to confirm if it was ok accept and continue. For travel the Outbound time changed to departing at 952pm arriving 640am and the return is not departing at 759pm. arriving 1144pm.\nuser: oh wow ok i didn't realize there were two changes to the timeframes. What are my options on next steps? If i don't accept do i pick new travel times and have to pay more money?   If i do accept for myself, then we're set on that piece. But if i don't accept for Scott do i get reimbursed for the first flight and need to choose a return flight? or can we just accept the return flight details?\nuser: What do you think?\nagent: At this time Kimi, there would be no reimbursement for the outbound due to the time change being 3 minutes, unless Scott cancels the whole ticket due to the return options  not being agreed to. As for the return, the options would be to accept, check for new times that work or cancellation if none are found.\nuser: so no flight credit if it's changed\nuser: ?\nagent: If the return is not feasible for travel, the airline may offer flight credit or full reimbursement if it falls into their guidelines of the schedule change, which I will gladly check if the 759pm departure is not acceptable\nuser: could you please check? I'll see if there are other flights as well\nagent: Sure Kimi allow me a moment to grab the details for you. Thank you for your patience.\nuser: Thank you\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi. Upon checking the guidelines, the booking would not be eligible for the refund as the delay is under 2 hours. If cancelled completely the airline will follow the fare rules of the ticket, which is non refundable.\nagent: I do see other flight time options with Alaska and Delta, as this is owned by Delta\nagent: So there can be a change made for no fee\nuser: oh great!\nuser: can we just accept the departure for both Scott and I from SFO to BOS and then make a change for free from BOS to SFO  for this flight? Or would there be an additional cost at all? \nagent: So how would you first like to move forward with your flight Kimi?\nagent: Ok Kimi, so that I have the proper details, you are looking to accept the outbound for both you and Scott, no longer cancelling Scott's trip. And looking to change the return to now depart on the 455pm departure BOS-SFO?\nuser: Yes please. I only want to change the return trip if it's truly no additional cost\nagent: Thank you for confirming Kimi. I am still here with you confirming with the airline directly, since the system is preventing me at this time to make the change at no cost. It may be due to the change from the airline being under 2 hours, so I just want to make sure it is truly not an option for you to change with no penalty.\nagent: Thank you for your continued patience and understanding\nuser: ok thanks for checking\nagent: Hey Kimi, checking in with you. Letting you know I am still here with you. :)\nuser: alrighty\nagent: Hey Kimi, you are greatly appreciated. I am still holding for assistance with the airline directly. Please let me know if you are still on the line with me?\nuser: here :)\nagent: THANK YOU!! :)\nuser: 😁😁\nagent: Hey Kimi, at this time Delta has a very long wait time, and I would hate to have you continue to wait with me.

Would this be a good contact number for you +19168133358?\nuser: yes please. what number will be reaching out so i'm prepared?\nuser: what if i miss the call? can i call you back?\nagent: It usually pops up as NAVAN on the caller id.

If you miss the call, you can call or chat back.
