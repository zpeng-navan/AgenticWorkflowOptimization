The previous passenger Aaron Smith should have been canceled. Can you assist?\nagent: I see you are chatting in about a booking for Aaron Smith?\nuser: Correct\nagent: I do see that you have current flight bookings for yourself, Aaron, and Andrea. Aaron's booking was made on March 27th and has not been amended, or canceled. It is currently active.\nuser: I chatted with someone about this a couple weeks ago when I re-booked for Andrea Sugino. I need Aaron Smith's booking to be canceled. Can you please cancel and confirm?\nuser: Credit back to the company account is fine\nagent: I have looked at Aaron's booking and see it is non-refundable, so if you cancel it, it will be issued as a flight credit for the original traveler, Aaron Smith. American Airlines tickets and credits are not transferable and can only be used by the originally ticketed person.\nuser: Even if the booking was paid for by a company card it can not be credited back to original payment?\nagent: I do see you chatted in a couple weeks ago about a booking for yourself KCSNTY, which was cancelled on April 21st.\nagent: Unfortunately, that is correct. American Airlines is very strict with their ticketing. Well, to be fair most of the airlines our there have the same ticketing policy with a few exceptions.\nuser: So it can't even be used as a credit through the Navan account and can only be returned to the passenger? \nuser: This passenger is not with the company and should not be issued the credit, There's no way around it? \nagent: It is not something that we can change or work around I am afraid. When a flight credit is issued, its basically just that same ticket as a credit (including ticket number, name, date of birth, etc) and when creating a new flight (to use the credit on) all of those elements have to match.\nagent: Its normally not an issue with business travelers as they tend to travel a bunch. I find that when companies are booking flights for new hires, or interview candidates, I recommend doing refundable tickets just for this very example.\nagent: Shall I go ahead and cancel that booking, CHVDEK, for Aaron?\nuser: If I keep the ticket and the passenger does not fly do they still get a credit refunded?\nagent: So if we leave it as is, the ticket will be marked as a no-show by the airline when they do not show up on the 4th for their flight. At that point AA will mark the ticket as suspended and it will have no value after that.\nuser: Okay let's just keep it as is \nagent: No worries, I will leave it as it. It can be cancelled basically anytime prior to flight, so if you decide you want to go ahead and cancel I would recommend doing it a couple hours before departure at the latest.\nuser: thank you\nagent: My pleasure, sorry for the strict ticketing information. For now, is there anything else I can look into for you?\nuser: That's all, thank you!\nagent: It was a pleasure assisting you today.

Which airport would you like to try for your search?\nuser: I can see flights available on Naveen itself I am confused as to why you’re not able to make me a booking\nnavan support: I understand why that's confusing! Sometimes flights appear for new bookings but aren't available for changes to an existing ticket—this can happen if the airline restricts certain fares for changes, or if they're sold out for corporate fares. If you see a specific flight you want, you can select it directly from the list. If you want to try a different route, date, or airline, just let me know and I can assist with another search.\nuser: Make me a new booking\nnavan support: If you want to make a new booking, you'll need to cancel your current flight first.

QAEEVX and BM7YV8\nagent: Thank you so much for letting me know about this, let me check the policy of each booking, to see our cancellation option. Please allow me at least 3-5 minutes on this. Thank you.\nuser: Thanks\nagent: You're very much welcome. I am currently checking this booking ID QAEEVX . Please allow me a minute.\nagent: Hi Angela, just wondering what might be the reason for the cancellation of the trip?\nuser: Eric is no longer with our company\nagent: I understand, thank you for sharing that. Upon checking here, the Delta flight with booking ID QAEEVX is non-refundable. Cancelling the flight will only provide a travel credit, which can be used for future travel bookings.\nagent: Would you like to proceed canceling the flight?\nuser: That works. Can it be applied to the whole company so whoever books something next would get the credit?\nagent: I am currently checking on it, please give me a few minutes.\nagent: Thank you so much for waiting, Angela. Upon checking here, the credit can only be transferred if your company have agreement with the airline directly for transferring unused credits to other travelers.\nagent: Credits are usually non-transferable to other travelers, but if the company have agreement with the airline directly, airlines do allow transferring of credits to other travelers.\nagent: Let me know how you would like to proceed on this.\nagent: And by the way, the other booking ID BM7YV8 has a flight with Southwest Airlines is also non-refundable. Same policy applies, the credit will be provided and can be used for future travel bookings.\nuser: Sounds like we just lose the whole ticket price then since Eric is not with our company any more and the credits can only be for Eric? \nuser: What email will the credit email be sent to?\nagent: Apparently, that is the policy the airline have given for the ticket restrictions. As much as we would love to help you with this, we are unable to transfer the credit, if the airlines won't allow it.\nagent: I can have it sent to your company email address.\nagent: Also, this credit will show up into your company's admin dashboard.\nuser: Ok, sounds good. Lets proceed with the cancel/credit for both flights\nagent: Thank you for confirming this, please allow me a minute to cancel this tickets.\nagent: Thank you so much for waiting, Angela. Apologies on the wait. I have successfully canceled both tickets here, and please keep note of the booking ID. These booking ID will be the same ID that you will need at the time you're ready to book using the credit.\nagent: Is there anything else you need aside from this that I can assist you with?\nuser: That is all.

The credit will have an expiration limit of 6 months.

Just cancelling Abbey's flight. Do you mean we would have to use the flight credit on a higher fare in the future? Or do you mean that I am being rebooked and will have to pay a higher fare for this flight?\nagent: you will need to use the flight credit for Abbey to rebook a higher fare in the future or risk losing the credit\nagent: your flight is protected\nuser: As long as my flight is protected and we are getting a credit back for Abbey then you are good to proceed. \nuser: That seems like a ridiculous rule on their part, though lol\nagent: Yes, sorry, I do see it has changed from the previous way of charging a cancellation fee. and I understand it is inconvenient ,we will keep your flight and upload Abbey's flight credit to her navan personal travel account after 5 business days\nagent: The cancellation is complete. Can I help you with anything else today?\nuser: Thanks. Even though the credit will be uploaded to Abbey's Navan account, would we be able to use it to book directly with Southwest, if need be? For instance, we recently booked with them directly due to a sale that did not appear on Navan. If that happens again can we use her flight credit outside of Navan?\nagent: You can make that request with Southwest directly , and provide the credit number that gets uploaded to the profile\nuser: Understood. Thanks for your help, Jordan\nagent: of course, can I help with something else today?\nuser: Not today, thanks.\nagent: It has been a pleasure assisting you today.
