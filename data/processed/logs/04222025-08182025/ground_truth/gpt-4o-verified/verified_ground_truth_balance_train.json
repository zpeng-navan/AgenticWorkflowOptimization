Sorry about that, Yes same thing if we cancel the BOS-SFO flight it will also affect the outbound flight.\nuser: we are not cancelling the outbound flight to BOS. We are keeping that segment since he will be going to YOW from BOS.\nagent: Yup, Got It! If you like we can try to reprice the ticket and just change it to just one way flight?

    "ava_part_body": "navan support: Hi Jeremiah-David\nnavan support: How can I assist you today?\nuser: Hi! I have a flight from LGA to YUL booked for May 17. I was looking at options to change it to May 16, but in the search results it says there aren't any fares available. However, if I begin a new search and look for a one-way ticket, I see some results. I was wondering why that is. Thanks!\nnavan support: Is this the flight: May 11 - 17\nRoundtrip YUL <-> LGA?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: When attempting to modify an existing booking, the availability of fares can differ from booking a new one-way ticket due to several reasons. Airlines may have specific rules that restrict self-serve changes through third-party platforms like Navan, or the flight might still be within the ticketing or void window. Additionally, inventory management for new bookings can differ from modifications, leading to different availability. If these conditions do not apply, you might need to explore other options or request an agent for further assistance.\nnavan support: This is an ongoing flight\nuser: Ah okay, so are there no options for me to change this flight?\nnavan support: Could you please clarify if you're looking to modify just your return flight from LGA to YUL, or if you intend to change both flights in your booking?\nuser: correct, I am just looking to change the flight from LGA to YUL\nnavan support: Currently, there are no available flights showing for a change from LGA to YUL on May 16 with your current booking. Sometimes, airlines limit what can be changed through the platform, even if new tickets are available separately. If you would like, I can keep checking for new options or assist you in exploring other ways to manage this.\nuser: I noticed within Navan it said that if I cancel my flight on the 17th, I would receive around $450CAD back in credit with the airline. Is this correct? If so, would it be possible to cancel the flight, receive the credit, and then book another one way ticket on the 16th?\nnavan support: Yeah, if you cancel this flight, you'll get about $454.39 CAD as a credit with Air Canada. You can use that credit to book a new flight with them—just keep in mind, there’s no airline change fee, but you’d need to check with Air Canada for how long the credit is valid.\nnavan support: Would you like to proceed with canceling your flight to receive the credit?\nuser: I would use the credit immediately, so I don't think that should be an issue (\"...you’d need to check with Air Canada for how long the credit is valid\")\nnavan support: Would you like to proceed with canceling the flight to apply the credit towards a new booking?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: You can cancel this flight and its value of $454.39 CAD will be banked with this airline as a future credit. When you make a new booking with this airline, no airline change fee will be charged.\nnavan support: Ok, I'm ready to cancel booking 3ULQ77. The following flights will be canceled: YUL -> LGA, LGA -> YUL.\nWould you like to proceed?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: Okay, I am on it. It will take me just a few seconds.\nnavan support: You're all set. I've canceled the booking and updated your itinerary.

I cannot do that\nnavan support: Yeah, those long layovers aren't ideal. Do you want to see flights with shorter layovers, or maybe try different times of day?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: I'll show you flights with shorter layovers. Is there a maximum layover time you'd prefer, or should I just show you the shortest ones available?\nuser: 2 to 3 hours maximum\nnavan support: No flights came up in economy with layovers under 3 hours. Want to try searching in business class to see if anything better pops up?\nuser: Please cancel this flight\nnavan support: Your flight can be canceled, but just a heads up—any credits or refunds will follow Southwest's policy.

Let me double check the return flight before we cancel anything\nuser: Thank you!\nagent: It does look like business is available on the same flights\nuser: Great, thanks for checking this Michelle!\nagent: I would recommend Jaime save their credit for a flight that is the same value or higher to get the full use out of it\nagent: and pay for this one outright\nagent: What would you like to do credit wise?\nuser: Since we booked this on the corporate card, I think we'd like to do a refund and rebook under the same card if I'm understanding correctly?\nagent: Unfortunately there is no refund, there would just be a credit with the airline for canceling the current flights\nagent: I was just recommending those be save to book in the future on a more expensive flight so they don't lose the value\nagent: As credits are one ticket for one ticket vs like a gift card deduction unfortunately\nuser: Ahh hmm. How do you suggest approaching this? I presume these credits will be issued to Jaime personally? As opposed to the company ?\nagent: They will be under Jamie's name, but can only be used through us for busines travel, unless approval from a manager or travel admin\nuser: So another employee would be able to utilize these credits for there travel with approval from a manager?\nuser: And if we proceed with this, are we able to use these credits for the LAS &gt; YYZ\nagent: Tickets are not transferrable to another person unless your company has a corporate agreement directly with an airline\nagent: It would stay under Jaime for them to book business travel within the experation date\nagent: expiration*\nuser: Just want to ensure I'm following correctly.\nuser: option A is to cancel this trip for 1,914.44 in airline credits, rebook the return for ~$1,500, and Jamie will have ~$400 credits with Air CA, only available through navan \nagent: Yes if we cancel, they will have a credit that can be used for business travel in the future with Air Canada\nagent: No sorry they would forfeit the rest\nagent: That is why I was advising to save the credits for the future to use the full value\nagent: One ticket per one ticket exchange with a credit - not like a gift card with a remainder\nagent: so we advise to wait until you have a flight 1914.44 or higher to use your full credit\nuser: Ahh gotcha. So if we leave things as is, we loose $250 in value after consideration for the $143 in charges\nagent: Yes that correct\nuser: Let me consult my team quickly apologies \nagent: No problem at all!\nagent: Happy to hang on the line\nuser: Thank you so much!\nagent: No trouble at all!\nuser: Just one moment, working through it\nagent: No problem, take your time\nuser: still here- thanks for your patience  \nagent: Yes definitely, no problem at all\nuser: I think we'll just keep the current flight as it, it makes more sense on our end\nagent: Okay sounds good!

We are not just giving flights away to people. \nagent: I’ll go ahead and process the cancellation as requested.\n\nRegarding the corporate ID, I provided the one currently listed on your account, as requested by United.

    "agent_part_body": "user: thank you\nuser: i was being helped yesterday but i fell asleep. I think the agent split the booking which i dont really understand what it means but it was so they could try to look into just adjusting Scott's on its own\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi and the details provided. It does show the agent split the PNRs so that you and Scott were no longer on the same reservation. No cancellation was made at the time, due to a schedule change the airline made, and the consultant was never able to confirm if it was ok accept and continue. For travel the Outbound time changed to departing at 952pm arriving 640am and the return is not departing at 759pm. arriving 1144pm.\nuser: oh wow ok i didn't realize there were two changes to the timeframes. What are my options on next steps? If i don't accept do i pick new travel times and have to pay more money?   If i do accept for myself, then we're set on that piece. But if i don't accept for Scott do i get reimbursed for the first flight and need to choose a return flight? or can we just accept the return flight details?\nuser: What do you think?\nagent: At this time Kimi, there would be no reimbursement for the outbound due to the time change being 3 minutes, unless Scott cancels the whole ticket due to the return options  not being agreed to. As for the return, the options would be to accept, check for new times that work or cancellation if none are found.\nuser: so no flight credit if it's changed\nuser: ?\nagent: If the return is not feasible for travel, the airline may offer flight credit or full reimbursement if it falls into their guidelines of the schedule change, which I will gladly check if the 759pm departure is not acceptable\nuser: could you please check? I'll see if there are other flights as well\nagent: Sure Kimi allow me a moment to grab the details for you. Thank you for your patience.\nuser: Thank you\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi. Upon checking the guidelines, the booking would not be eligible for the refund as the delay is under 2 hours. If cancelled completely the airline will follow the fare rules of the ticket, which is non refundable.\nagent: I do see other flight time options with Alaska and Delta, as this is owned by Delta\nagent: So there can be a change made for no fee\nuser: oh great!\nuser: can we just accept the departure for both Scott and I from SFO to BOS and then make a change for free from BOS to SFO  for this flight? Or would there be an additional cost at all? \nagent: So how would you first like to move forward with your flight Kimi?\nagent: Ok Kimi, so that I have the proper details, you are looking to accept the outbound for both you and Scott, no longer cancelling Scott's trip. And looking to change the return to now depart on the 455pm departure BOS-SFO?\nuser: Yes please. I only want to change the return trip if it's truly no additional cost\nagent: Thank you for confirming Kimi. I am still here with you confirming with the airline directly, since the system is preventing me at this time to make the change at no cost. It may be due to the change from the airline being under 2 hours, so I just want to make sure it is truly not an option for you to change with no penalty.\nagent: Thank you for your continued patience and understanding\nuser: ok thanks for checking\nagent: Hey Kimi, checking in with you. Letting you know I am still here with you. :)\nuser: alrighty\nagent: Hey Kimi, you are greatly appreciated. I am still holding for assistance with the airline directly. Please let me know if you are still on the line with me?\nuser: here :)\nagent: THANK YOU!! :)\nuser: 😁😁\nagent: Hey Kimi, at this time Delta has a very long wait time, and I would hate to have you continue to wait with me. I can definitely contact you back once I have a resolution on how we can move forward. Would this be a good contact number for you +19168133358?\nuser: yes please. what number will be reaching out so i'm prepared?\nuser: what if i miss the call? can i call you back?\nagent: It usually pops up as NAVAN on the caller id. Our contact number is 1844-718-7773. You may call that number back but there is no guarantee you will reach me directly, I don't have a direct line or ext. If you miss the call, you can call or chat back. You & Scott's booking will be notated for what we worked on so the next agent can assist you from there and not start fully from scratch.\nuser: ok thank you\nuser: have a great day\nuser: ttys!\nagent: You are very welcome.

Would you like to see if there are seats available in Economy class from Gatwick instead?\nuser: would i get a credit if i canceled the return and booked the 9:35 direct flght on delta?\nnavan support: If you cancel your return flight, whether you get a credit depends on Delta's policy for your ticket.

What happens is the airline won't allow us to cancel the return as-is. and forces you to exchange the ticket to a one-way instead. However, there's a workaround to this, which is to simply have Michael fly to DCA first, and then we can cancel the return since the outbound portion of the ticket will be marked as 'flown' then, and we can hold it as a partial credit.\nagent: A bit of a hassle but that is definitely the easiest way\nuser: if we cancel the return now wouldn't he also have it as a credit\nagent: No, so what happens is the airline will see he has a ticket that goes from ORD to DCA, and DCA and ORD, but that his itinerary only has ORD to DCA. They won't allow him to board that since the ticket doesn't match the itinerary.\nagent: It sounds really silly but that's how it works with the airlines.\nagent: What they will require is instead a ticket that goes ORD to DCA only, if that's what Michael's intentions to board are.\nuser: if I want his return to be a different destination than ORD can we do that \nagent: Now, here's where it gets confusing: The same problem doesn't happen with American Airlines and Delta. They allow residual credits so that makes the process easier, but United are a little harder to deal with\nagent: Yes, we can do that as well.\nuser: OK, then I don't need to do anything as of right now, thank you!\nagent: Noted!

I asked whether any of the following options would be permitted:\n\nName Change – Unfortunately, they do not allow name changes.\n\nTransfer to Another Employee – They do not permit the ticket to be transferred into a voucher for use by another company employee.\n\nTransfer to UATP Card – This option is not offered at all.\n\nThe agent confirmed that the credit can only be used through Navan by the same traveler. Since the booking was made using company funds, our policy does not allow exchanges for personal travel unless explicitly approved by a company Admin.\nuser: This was for a business purpose (flying to another program site)\nagent: So in that case we would not allow the traveler to use this ticket for her personal travel in the future.\nuser: Oh okay.\nagent: I am sorry that we could not get help with this credit from the airline!\nuser: That's okay - I do appreciate your help.\nagent: You are most welcome Danielle.

Allow me 3-5 minutes.\nagent: Thank you for waiting, as I checked here this ticket is non refundable, however, can cancel this flight and its value of $438.63 CAD will be banked with this airline as a future credit. When you make a new booking with this airline, an airline change fee of $200 CAD will be charged. Should I go ahead and proceed?\nuser: is it just a credit under talia's name or could it be for the company \nuser: (I am admin, logging in as Talia right now) \nagent: Yes, the credit will be under the name of Talia, and this credit cannot be transfer to other traveler. Unless you have an approval from the airlines or obtain a unique waiver code to transfer the credit to the other name.\nuser: okay, talia no longer works for the company so it doesn't make sense to get a credit \nuser: Not a problem if its non refundable - last time we cancelled and it was non refundable we received the tax credit back. Is that the same in this case too?\nagent: I understand and I agree on you. Yes, it might be possible to process the unused taxes I just need to send it to our ticketing team. for them to calculate the unused taxes.\nuser: okay great \nuser: thank you for your help\nagent: Okay, sure I will go ahead and cancel this booking now.

I am already looking for an option. Please give me a few minutes to check the policy.\nuser: Thanks\nagent: Your most welcome, Mitchell. Kindly give me a few minutes to check this.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, upon checking with United Airlines policy, cancelling the outbound flight and keeping the return is a proces of change. Because a new ticket needs to be issued for the return flight as the ticket that Brian have is currently roundtrip.\nagent: Upon checking there's actually no change fee for changing your flight, however, there will be also no fee in cancelling the outbound now. How would you like to proceed on this?\nuser: Do you mean we need to cancel the roundtrip flight and rebook just the return flight but we can do so for free?\nagent: Yes, that's right.\nuser: Okay. Would you be able to help with that?\nagent: Yes, of course. Do you wish to proceed in cancelling and keeping the return flight?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Perfect! Thank you for that.

Apparently, there's no window seat that is free on the flight from DEN to COS, but the airline will provide a seat once checked in.\nagent: Will there be anything else that I can assist you with?\nuser: Thank you for dong that! And these updates will show up in the Navan trip for Brian to see?\nagent: Yes, you can try checking that through his Navan profile, as the flight has already been updated.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, I also noticed that Brian does have a hotel booking, however upon checking here, the hotel rooms are non-refundable. Any changes that you may want to check will be cancelling this, and rebooking a new one.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, is there anything else you need assistance with?\nuser: No that is all.
