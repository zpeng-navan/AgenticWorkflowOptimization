Let me know if you want to see more options or need help with anything else.\nuser: No I cannot, it is not letting me exchange it for an economy ticket\nnavan support: Sometimes, certain fare types or tickets can't be exchanged for a different cabin class, like from first class to economy, especially if your original ticket was in a higher class. If you want, I can show you more economy options or help you with a different search. Let me know what you'd like to do next.\nuser: I need to exchange for an economy ticket\nnavan support: It looks like your original ticket is in first class, and most airlines—including United—don't allow exchanges from a higher cabin like first class to economy. If you want to switch to economy, you'd usually need to cancel your current ticket and book a new one in economy. Your ticket's value would be banked as a credit with United for future use. Want to go ahead with that, or do you want to keep looking at first class options?\nnavan support: How can I help you with your booking?\nuser: yes, cancel and rebook\nnavan support: You can cancel this flight and its value of $1,407.19 will be banked with this airline as a future credit.

It could be sold out for corporate fares or blocked for exchanges. If you want, I can help you try a different airport, a different date, or even look at switching to a different airline, but that would mean canceling your current flight and booking a new one.\nuser: I see it on Navan\nnavan support: You might be seeing a different fare class or time range than what we've searched for.

Sometimes flights show up for new bookings but aren't open for changes, or they might be sold out in the fare classes allowed for exchanges. If you want, I can show all available flights for that day so you can pick from everything that's open for a change.\nuser: sure\nnavan support: There aren't any flights available for a change from Grand Rapids to West Palm Beach on July 13.

Here are the top options.\nuser: I need to travel from SAN to PHX on the 7:32 pm flight\nnavan support: To update your booking to go from SAN to PHX on the evening of the 25th, then PHX to ORD to LHR on the 26th, I'll need to search for flights with this new routing. Do you want to fly first class for all segments, and is there a specific airline you want to stick with for these flights?\nuser: First class and American Airlines / British Airwats\nnavan support: I see you want to change your outbound flight to a multi-segment trip: SAN to PHX, then PHX to ORD, and finally ORD to LHR, all in first class. Since I can only search by one flight route at a time, which segment would you like me to focus on first? The SAN to PHX leg on the evening of the 25th, the PHX to ORD leg on the 26th, or the ORD to LHR leg also on the 26th?\nuser: I have found all of the flights I need.   This is the third time I have attempted to do this and it is really not easy.   If I cancel my existing booking can I simply rebook or am I better off amending?\nnavan support: You can cancel your current booking and the value (£4,021.58 GBP) will be banked as a future credit with American Airlines. When you rebook, there'll be a £300 GBP change fee plus any fare difference. Amending your booking directly has the same fee structure. If you already found the flights you want, you can amend your booking here or cancel and rebook—cost-wise, it's about the same. Let me know if you want to move forward with either option.\nnavan support: Do you need help with anything else?\nuser: Let's try to amend.  Start with the SAN to PHX flight on the 25th on AA leaving at 7:32 pm \nnavan support: I don't see a SAN to PHX flight in your booking. Are you looking to change your SAN to LHR flight, or is this about a different trip?\nuser: Yes - SAN to LHR becomes SAN to PHX to ORD to LHR\nnavan support: To change your SAN to LHR flight to a route with stops in PHX and ORD, would you like to stay with American Airlines, or are you open to exploring other airlines as well?\nuser: Yes American Airlines\nnavan support: Let's look for a change to this original flight \n\nSAN -> LHR:09/26/2025 07:13 AM\nnavan support: I found 23 first class flights from SAN to LHR departing on September 26 (local time). Here are the top 20.

Here are the top 20.\nuser: There has to be an easier way.  I would like to fy from SAN to PHX on the 25th on the AA flight leaving at 7:32 pm.   I would spend the night in PHX.  On the 26th, I would fly from PHX to ORD to LHR\nnavan support: To set this up, I'd need to search for a SAN to PHX flight on the 25th, then PHX to ORD to LHR on the 26th, all with American Airlines. Are you looking for first class on all segments, or are you open to other cabins for any part of the trip?\nuser: first\nnavan support: Just to confirm, you only want to change your SAN to LHR flight to this new routing with the overnight in PHX, right? The other flights in your booking stay as they are.\nuser: correct\nnavan support: I see you want to change the SAN to LHR leg to a multi-stop route: SAN to PHX on 9/25, then PHX to ORD and ORD to LHR on 9/26, all in first class. Since I can only search by one flight route at a time, which leg do you want me to focus on updating first—SAN to PHX, PHX to ORD, or ORD to LHR?\nuser: SAN to PHX first\nnavan support: Let's look for a change to this original flight \n\nSAN -> LHR:09/26/2025 07:13 AM\nnavan support: I found 1 flight from SAN to PHX leaving between 7:02pm and 8:02pm (local time).\nuser: I think I am just going to cancel and rebook.  The new flights appear to cost £4300 (slightly more than the original booking)\nnavan support: You can cancel this flight and its value of £4,021.58 GBP will be banked with American Airlines as a future credit.

I was looking at options to change it to May 16, but in the search results it says there aren't any fares available. However, if I begin a new search and look for a one-way ticket, I see some results. I was wondering why that is. Thanks!\nnavan support: Is this the flight: May 11 - 17\nRoundtrip YUL <-> LGA?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: When attempting to modify an existing booking, the availability of fares can differ from booking a new one-way ticket due to several reasons. Airlines may have specific rules that restrict self-serve changes through third-party platforms like Navan, or the flight might still be within the ticketing or void window. Additionally, inventory management for new bookings can differ from modifications, leading to different availability. If these conditions do not apply, you might need to explore other options or request an agent for further assistance.\nnavan support: This is an ongoing flight\nuser: Ah okay, so are there no options for me to change this flight?\nnavan support: Could you please clarify if you're looking to modify just your return flight from LGA to YUL, or if you intend to change both flights in your booking?\nuser: correct, I am just looking to change the flight from LGA to YUL\nnavan support: Currently, there are no available flights showing for a change from LGA to YUL on May 16 with your current booking. Sometimes, airlines limit what can be changed through the platform, even if new tickets are available separately. If you would like, I can keep checking for new options or assist you in exploring other ways to manage this.\nuser: I noticed within Navan it said that if I cancel my flight on the 17th, I would receive around $450CAD back in credit with the airline. Is this correct? If so, would it be possible to cancel the flight, receive the credit, and then book another one way ticket on the 16th?\nnavan support: Yeah, if you cancel this flight, you'll get about $454.39 CAD as a credit with Air Canada. You can use that credit to book a new flight with them—just keep in mind, there’s no airline change fee, but you’d need to check with Air Canada for how long the credit is valid.\nnavan support: Would you like to proceed with canceling your flight to receive the credit?\nuser: I would use the credit immediately, so I don't think that should be an issue (\"...you’d need to check with Air Canada for how long the credit is valid\")\nnavan support: Would you like to proceed with canceling the flight to apply the credit towards a new booking?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: You can cancel this flight and its value of $454.39 CAD will be banked with this airline as a future credit.

If the flight is still scheduled and has not been canceled, you will need to wait until it is officially canceled or significantly changed to qualify for a reimbursement.\nagent: Now looking on the rules and policy of this ticket You can cancel this flight and its value of $663.37 will be banked with this airline as a future credit.\nuser: I will cancel it but can we transfer the future credit to another employee still within the company?  \nuser: I just canceled the her flight\nagent: Let me check if this can be transferred to another employee.\nuser: Thank you! \nagent: The answer to your question is No, we cannot transfer future credits to another employee within the company. Corporate travel credits earned during employment are not transferable between employees, even if they are still with the company.\nagent: But I can try to contact delta and let them know about your inquiry.\nagent: and see if they can transfer it with different passenger, but then again it is not guarantee.\nuser: Ok, that would be great if you could!  Thank you! \nagent: Awesome! Now since Delta has a very long waiting time to be connected, Is it okay If I just give you an email update for it ?\nuser: Yes, that works thank you!!\nagent: Awesome!

What happens is the airline won't allow us to cancel the return as-is. and forces you to exchange the ticket to a one-way instead. However, there's a workaround to this, which is to simply have Michael fly to DCA first, and then we can cancel the return since the outbound portion of the ticket will be marked as 'flown' then, and we can hold it as a partial credit.\nagent: A bit of a hassle but that is definitely the easiest way\nuser: if we cancel the return now wouldn't he also have it as a credit\nagent: No, so what happens is the airline will see he has a ticket that goes from ORD to DCA, and DCA and ORD, but that his itinerary only has ORD to DCA. They won't allow him to board that since the ticket doesn't match the itinerary.\nagent: It sounds really silly but that's how it works with the airlines.\nagent: What they will require is instead a ticket that goes ORD to DCA only, if that's what Michael's intentions to board are.\nuser: if I want his return to be a different destination than ORD can we do that \nagent: Now, here's where it gets confusing: The same problem doesn't happen with American Airlines and Delta. They allow residual credits so that makes the process easier, but United are a little harder to deal with\nagent: Yes, we can do that as well.\nuser: OK, then I don't need to do anything as of right now, thank you!\nagent: Noted!

Can you confirm that as well?\nagent: I do see there will be a credit, would you allow me a few moments to verify if there is any cancellation fee?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Per southwest policy there  will be no cancellation fee. The credit will have an expiration limit of 6 months. We will need to escalate the concern to our support team at this time to split the booking then cancel for Abbey, so as not to interrupt your flights.

Just cancelling Abbey's flight. Do you mean we would have to use the flight credit on a higher fare in the future? Or do you mean that I am being rebooked and will have to pay a higher fare for this flight?\nagent: you will need to use the flight credit for Abbey to rebook a higher fare in the future or risk losing the credit\nagent: your flight is protected\nuser: As long as my flight is protected and we are getting a credit back for Abbey then you are good to proceed. \nuser: That seems like a ridiculous rule on their part, though lol\nagent: Yes, sorry, I do see it has changed from the previous way of charging a cancellation fee. and I understand it is inconvenient ,we will keep your flight and upload Abbey's flight credit to her navan personal travel account after 5 business days\nagent: The cancellation is complete. Can I help you with anything else today?\nuser: Thanks. Even though the credit will be uploaded to Abbey's Navan account, would we be able to use it to book directly with Southwest, if need be? For instance, we recently booked with them directly due to a sale that did not appear on Navan. If that happens again can we use her flight credit outside of Navan?\nagent: You can make that request with Southwest directly , and provide the credit number that gets uploaded to the profile\nuser: Understood. Thanks for your help, Jordan\nagent: of course, can I help with something else today?\nuser: Not today, thanks.\nagent: It has been a pleasure assisting you today.

The previous passenger Aaron Smith should have been canceled. Can you assist?\nagent: I see you are chatting in about a booking for Aaron Smith?\nuser: Correct\nagent: I do see that you have current flight bookings for yourself, Aaron, and Andrea. Aaron's booking was made on March 27th and has not been amended, or canceled. It is currently active.\nuser: I chatted with someone about this a couple weeks ago when I re-booked for Andrea Sugino. I need Aaron Smith's booking to be canceled. Can you please cancel and confirm?\nuser: Credit back to the company account is fine\nagent: I have looked at Aaron's booking and see it is non-refundable, so if you cancel it, it will be issued as a flight credit for the original traveler, Aaron Smith. American Airlines tickets and credits are not transferable and can only be used by the originally ticketed person.\nuser: Even if the booking was paid for by a company card it can not be credited back to original payment?\nagent: I do see you chatted in a couple weeks ago about a booking for yourself KCSNTY, which was cancelled on April 21st.\nagent: Unfortunately, that is correct. American Airlines is very strict with their ticketing. Well, to be fair most of the airlines our there have the same ticketing policy with a few exceptions.\nuser: So it can't even be used as a credit through the Navan account and can only be returned to the passenger? \nuser: This passenger is not with the company and should not be issued the credit, There's no way around it? \nagent: It is not something that we can change or work around I am afraid. When a flight credit is issued, its basically just that same ticket as a credit (including ticket number, name, date of birth, etc) and when creating a new flight (to use the credit on) all of those elements have to match.\nagent: Its normally not an issue with business travelers as they tend to travel a bunch. I find that when companies are booking flights for new hires, or interview candidates, I recommend doing refundable tickets just for this very example.\nagent: Shall I go ahead and cancel that booking, CHVDEK, for Aaron?\nuser: If I keep the ticket and the passenger does not fly do they still get a credit refunded?\nagent: So if we leave it as is, the ticket will be marked as a no-show by the airline when they do not show up on the 4th for their flight.

You seem to be chatting about cancelling Brian's outbound flight and keep the return, right?\nuser: Yes that is correct. When I went to do this on my own, the only option I saw was to cancel both ways. Would he get a credit for the cancelled outbound flight?\nagent: Let me go ahead and check on that. I am already looking for an option. Please give me a few minutes to check the policy.\nuser: Thanks\nagent: Your most welcome, Mitchell. Kindly give me a few minutes to check this.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, upon checking with United Airlines policy, cancelling the outbound flight and keeping the return is a proces of change. Because a new ticket needs to be issued for the return flight as the ticket that Brian have is currently roundtrip.\nagent: Upon checking there's actually no change fee for changing your flight, however, there will be also no fee in cancelling the outbound now. How would you like to proceed on this?\nuser: Do you mean we need to cancel the roundtrip flight and rebook just the return flight but we can do so for free?\nagent: Yes, that's right.\nuser: Okay. Would you be able to help with that?\nagent: Yes, of course. Do you wish to proceed in cancelling and keeping the return flight?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Perfect! Thank you for that. Kindly stay connected and allow me 2-3 minutes to complete this before we end the chat. Okay?\nagent: Thank you so much for waiting, Mitchell. I managed to change the flight of Brian.

Apparently, there's no window seat that is free on the flight from DEN to COS, but the airline will provide a seat once checked in.\nagent: Will there be anything else that I can assist you with?\nuser: Thank you for dong that! And these updates will show up in the Navan trip for Brian to see?\nagent: Yes, you can try checking that through his Navan profile, as the flight has already been updated.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, I also noticed that Brian does have a hotel booking, however upon checking here, the hotel rooms are non-refundable. Any changes that you may want to check will be cancelling this, and rebooking a new one.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, is there anything else you need assistance with?\nuser: No that is all.

So when you're ready to use the credit for a different traveler, just reach out to us—we’ll be happy to assist with the name change. Please note that United may charge an additional fee of up to $100 for the name change on the ticket.\nagent: I did check the policy for the hotel, and i see the booking is non-refundable for changes and cancellation, however, i can call up the hotel and check if we can get a waiver for free cancellation.\nuser: That would be amazing if possible 😱\nuser: usually our candidates book their own flights, is it possible to apply the remaining credits AFTER the flight is booked, or does it have to be before?\nagent: Vivian, they may need to call us directly, as this process has to be completed within the United system. I can provide a confirmation or reference number, and if someone contacts us to use the credit, we’ll gladly assist them in booking a new trip and applying the credit to their new flight.\nagent: I am sorry it's taking longer than expected.

The hotel is currently busy and asked me to call back a bit later.

Just need to confirm we are only canceling the YYZ to LAS and the LAS to YYZ (return) will not be canceled \nagent: Ahh I see you are trying to cancel just the departure, unfortunately you aren't able to just cancel and outbound and keep a return\nagent: The whole flight would be canceled and then would need to rebook the return.\nuser: Ah bummer... Understood. Would you be able to assist in this? \nagent: Yes definitely! Let me double check the return flight before we cancel anything\nuser: Thank you!\nagent: It does look like business is available on the same flights\nuser: Great, thanks for checking this Michelle!\nagent: I would recommend Jaime save their credit for a flight that is the same value or higher to get the full use out of it\nagent: and pay for this one outright\nagent: What would you like to do credit wise?\nuser: Since we booked this on the corporate card, I think we'd like to do a refund and rebook under the same card if I'm understanding correctly?\nagent: Unfortunately there is no refund, there would just be a credit with the airline for canceling the current flights\nagent: I was just recommending those be save to book in the future on a more expensive flight so they don't lose the value\nagent: As credits are one ticket for one ticket vs like a gift card deduction unfortunately\nuser: Ahh hmm. How do you suggest approaching this? I presume these credits will be issued to Jaime personally? As opposed to the company ?\nagent: They will be under Jamie's name, but can only be used through us for busines travel, unless approval from a manager or travel admin\nuser: So another employee would be able to utilize these credits for there travel with approval from a manager?\nuser: And if we proceed with this, are we able to use these credits for the LAS &gt; YYZ\nagent: Tickets are not transferrable to another person unless your company has a corporate agreement directly with an airline\nagent: It would stay under Jaime for them to book business travel within the experation date\nagent: expiration*\nuser: Just want to ensure I'm following correctly.\nuser: option A is to cancel this trip for 1,914.44 in airline credits, rebook the return for ~$1,500, and Jamie will have ~$400 credits with Air CA, only available through navan \nagent: Yes if we cancel, they will have a credit that can be used for business travel in the future with Air Canada\nagent: No sorry they would forfeit the rest\nagent: That is why I was advising to save the credits for the future to use the full value\nagent: One ticket per one ticket exchange with a credit - not like a gift card with a remainder\nagent: so we advise to wait until you have a flight 1914.44 or higher to use your full credit\nuser: Ahh gotcha. So if we leave things as is, we loose $250 in value after consideration for the $143 in charges\nagent: Yes that correct\nuser: Let me consult my team quickly apologies \nagent: No problem at all!\nagent: Happy to hang on the line\nuser: Thank you so much!\nagent: No trouble at all!\nuser: Just one moment, working through it\nagent: No problem, take your time\nuser: still here- thanks for your patience  \nagent: Yes definitely, no problem at all\nuser: I think we'll just keep the current flight as it, it makes more sense on our end\nagent: Okay sounds good! No changes or cancellations on the current flight\nagent: Anything else I can help you with at this time?\nuser: yes! Thank you again!\nagent: You are very welcome!\nagent: It would mean a lot to me if you took the time to take the survey at the end of this chat on my specific service, not the platform or any wait times you may have had.\n\nIf any other questions arise, please feel free to contact us at any time.

Just a moment, please.\nagent: Hello Kimi, my name is April and I will be glad to assist you today. Please allow me a moment to review the details of your request provided to further assist you",
    "agent_part_body": "user: thank you\nuser: i was being helped yesterday but i fell asleep. I think the agent split the booking which i dont really understand what it means but it was so they could try to look into just adjusting Scott's on its own\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi and the details provided. It does show the agent split the PNRs so that you and Scott were no longer on the same reservation. No cancellation was made at the time, due to a schedule change the airline made, and the consultant was never able to confirm if it was ok accept and continue. For travel the Outbound time changed to departing at 952pm arriving 640am and the return is not departing at 759pm. arriving 1144pm.\nuser: oh wow ok i didn't realize there were two changes to the timeframes. What are my options on next steps? If i don't accept do i pick new travel times and have to pay more money?   If i do accept for myself, then we're set on that piece. But if i don't accept for Scott do i get reimbursed for the first flight and need to choose a return flight? or can we just accept the return flight details?\nuser: What do you think?\nagent: At this time Kimi, there would be no reimbursement for the outbound due to the time change being 3 minutes, unless Scott cancels the whole ticket due to the return options  not being agreed to. As for the return, the options would be to accept, check for new times that work or cancellation if none are found.\nuser: so no flight credit if it's changed\nuser: ?\nagent: If the return is not feasible for travel, the airline may offer flight credit or full reimbursement if it falls into their guidelines of the schedule change, which I will gladly check if the 759pm departure is not acceptable\nuser: could you please check? I'll see if there are other flights as well\nagent: Sure Kimi allow me a moment to grab the details for you. Thank you for your patience.\nuser: Thank you\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi. Upon checking the guidelines, the booking would not be eligible for the refund as the delay is under 2 hours. If cancelled completely the airline will follow the fare rules of the ticket, which is non refundable.\nagent: I do see other flight time options with Alaska and Delta, as this is owned by Delta\nagent: So there can be a change made for no fee\nuser: oh great!\nuser: can we just accept the departure for both Scott and I from SFO to BOS and then make a change for free from BOS to SFO  for this flight? Or would there be an additional cost at all? \nagent: So how would you first like to move forward with your flight Kimi?\nagent: Ok Kimi, so that I have the proper details, you are looking to accept the outbound for both you and Scott, no longer cancelling Scott's trip. And looking to change the return to now depart on the 455pm departure BOS-SFO?\nuser: Yes please. I only want to change the return trip if it's truly no additional cost\nagent: Thank you for confirming Kimi. I am still here with you confirming with the airline directly, since the system is preventing me at this time to make the change at no cost. It may be due to the change from the airline being under 2 hours, so I just want to make sure it is truly not an option for you to change with no penalty.\nagent: Thank you for your continued patience and understanding\nuser: ok thanks for checking\nagent: Hey Kimi, checking in with you. Letting you know I am still here with you. :)\nuser: alrighty\nagent: Hey Kimi, you are greatly appreciated. I am still holding for assistance with the airline directly. Please let me know if you are still on the line with me?\nuser: here :)\nagent: THANK YOU!! :)\nuser: 😁😁\nagent: Hey Kimi, at this time Delta has a very long wait time, and I would hate to have you continue to wait with me. I can definitely contact you back once I have a resolution on how we can move forward. Would this be a good contact number for you +19168133358?\nuser: yes please. what number will be reaching out so i'm prepared?\nuser: what if i miss the call? can i call you back?\nagent: It usually pops up as NAVAN on the caller id. Our contact number is 1844-718-7773. You may call that number back but there is no guarantee you will reach me directly, I don't have a direct line or ext. If you miss the call, you can call or chat back. You & Scott's booking will be notated for what we worked on so the next agent can assist you from there and not start fully from scratch.\nuser: ok thank you\nuser: have a great day\nuser: ttys!\nagent: You are very welcome.  If you have a moment, I would love to hear your feedback on your experience with my service. Please take a short survey to help us improve our service. Your input is greatly valued! TTYS Kimi!!",

Allow me 3-5 minutes.\nagent: Thank you for waiting, as I checked here this ticket is non refundable, however, can cancel this flight and its value of $438.63 CAD will be banked with this airline as a future credit. When you make a new booking with this airline, an airline change fee of $200 CAD will be charged. Should I go ahead and proceed?\nuser: is it just a credit under talia's name or could it be for the company \nuser: (I am admin, logging in as Talia right now) \nagent: Yes, the credit will be under the name of Talia, and this credit cannot be transfer to other traveler. Unless you have an approval from the airlines or obtain a unique waiver code to transfer the credit to the other name.\nuser: okay, talia no longer works for the company so it doesn't make sense to get a credit \nuser: Not a problem if its non refundable - last time we cancelled and it was non refundable we received the tax credit back. Is that the same in this case too?\nagent: I understand and I agree on you. Yes, it might be possible to process the unused taxes I just need to send it to our ticketing team. for them to calculate the unused taxes.\nuser: okay great \nuser: thank you for your help\nagent: Okay, sure I will go ahead and cancel this booking now.
