Am I correct?\nuser: yes, please\nagent: Let me confirm that with American Airlines. As they owned the ticket.\nuser: the ticket was purchased via corporate card.\nagent: Would you like me to send you an email update or a callback, perhaps? or if you're willing to stay connected in this chat that is also okay.\nuser: an email would be fine,\nagent: That is duly noted, Davonna.\nuser: but I can try to remain on the chat\nagent: Once I have the details from American Airlines will send you an email update on your company email address.\nuser: Davonna@beewise.ag\nagent: Thank you Davonna\nagent: I am now coordinating with American Airlines.\nagent: Hi Davonna, are we still connected?\nuser: yes\nagent: I spoke with Claudia from American Airlines who initially checked if name change is allowed per the ticket policy; However, it says that name change is not allowed meaning you if there will be a credit it cannot be transferred to a different employee.\nagent: Hence I ask her to check other options.\nuser: I appreciate that\nagent: You're welcome.\nagent: Hi Davonna\nuser: hi\nagent: Claudia contacted their higher department regarding the concern on transferring the credit to a different employee; However, per her, they will have to follow the policy implimented by the International Air Transport Association if the ticket says it is non transferrable then they are unable to transfer it.\nagent: On the other hand she advised you can submit a contact form with American Airlines from their website.\nagent: If you want I can submit the form and just add your email address so that if they will respond you will receive it.\nuser: Yes, that would be helpful. \nagent: Sure, let me fill it out for you.\nuser: The ticket needs to be canceled, before the flight so it doesn't reflect a no-show.

Would you like to make changes to your flight booking, or is there something else I can help with regarding this situation?\nuser: Changes to flight booking\nnavan support: Did you want to change your departure flight from TUS to LGA, your return flight from JFK to TUS, or both flights?\nuser: JKF to TUS\nnavan support: Let's explore options for changing this original flight \n\nJFK -> TUS:06/12/2025 06:20 PM\nnavan support: Since you've already checked in, you'll need to cancel your check-in on the airline's website before changing your flight. For American Airlines, you can do this at https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/contact-american/reservations-and-ticket-changes.jsp. After you uncheck-in, let me know and I can help with the changes.\nuser: Waiting for them to call me back to uncheck in since I can't do it online\nnavan support: No problem—just let me know once American Airlines helps you uncheck-in. After your status updates, I can help with changing your flight.\nuser: Will we be able to change to a different airline? or will I need to cancel the American flight to book on delta?\nnavan support: Once you're unchecked in, I can look into options for you—either changing to a different American flight or canceling and booking a Delta one, depending on the airline policy and ticket rules. You don't need to cancel your American flight yourself right now; let's see what's possible once your status updates.\nuser: They said that I can't uncheck in and that I need to just cancel and get a refund. \nnavan support: Since American Airlines told you to cancel and get a refund, I recommend waiting until your check-in status updates in our system, which can take a few minutes. Once that's done, I can help you with canceling your existing flight and booking a new one, including options on Delta if you want.\nuser: They can't uncheck me in, so I think we are good to cancel. Should I go ahead and go that myself?\nnavan support: There's no need to cancel your flight on your own. Once your check-in status updates in our system, I can assist you in canceling your American Airlines flight and explore new options, including Delta. I'll stay on the lookout for the update—just let me know if you notice any status change.\nuser: What status update are you looking for?\nnavan support: I'm monitoring your booking status to update from 'checked in' to 'not checked in' in our system. Once it updates, I can assist with canceling your flight or booking a new one. It may take a few minutes for the update to appear after communicating with the airline.\nuser: Again - they can not uncheck me in \nnavan support: Thanks for clarifying. Since American Airlines can't uncheck you in, and you're still showing as checked in on our end, I can't process a change or cancellation until the status updates. If the airline can't help and you remain checked in, we’re stuck until the check-in expires on their system—sometimes that's after the flight departs. Once the status changes, I can help with your refund or rebooking. If you need to talk to a human agent for more help, just let me know.\nuser: I need to speak with a human agent\nnavan support: Just a heads up—waiting for a human agent can take a while, and sometimes it's actually faster to wait for the check-in status to update in the system. As soon as it does, I can help you cancel and look at new flights right away. If you still want to talk to a human, let me know and I'll connect you.\nuser: Again - they can not change the status. I will just cancel myself and rebook\nnavan support: I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. To resolve your question with an agent, there may be a fee. Information about support fees can be found in this [article](https://bit.ly/emea-fees)\nnavan support: Do you want me to transfer you?\nuser: Yes\nnavan support: Let me connect you with one of our experts.

    "agent_part_body": "user: sounds good!\nagent: OK just a quick answer on that, I see the booking is non-refundable. What happens is the airline won't allow us to cancel the return as-is. and forces you to exchange the ticket to a one-way instead. However, there's a workaround to this, which is to simply have Michael fly to DCA first, and then we can cancel the return since the outbound portion of the ticket will be marked as 'flown' then, and we can hold it as a partial credit.\nagent: A bit of a hassle but that is definitely the easiest way\nuser: if we cancel the return now wouldn't he also have it as a credit\nagent: No, so what happens is the airline will see he has a ticket that goes from ORD to DCA, and DCA and ORD, but that his itinerary only has ORD to DCA. They won't allow him to board that since the ticket doesn't match the itinerary.\nagent: It sounds really silly but that's how it works with the airlines.\nagent: What they will require is instead a ticket that goes ORD to DCA only, if that's what Michael's intentions to board are.\nuser: if I want his return to be a different destination than ORD can we do that \nagent: Now, here's where it gets confusing: The same problem doesn't happen with American Airlines and Delta. They allow residual credits so that makes the process easier, but United are a little harder to deal with\nagent: Yes, we can do that as well.\nuser: OK, then I don't need to do anything as of right now, thank you!\nagent: Noted!

Let me have a look here.\nuser: or credit \nagent: You are requesting to cancel both flights, correct?\nagent: June 15, LCY-RTM and June 20, RTM-LCY.\nuser: Yes, but I want to check before cancelling if i can transfer to someone else and change the name or get credit \nuser: before when i looked at cancelling another flight it charged me to cancel so it was better to not cancel and they just didn't turn up \nagent: Upon checking here, it looks like the ticket is non refundable and non transferable. The airlines can allow change but it cannot be cancelled and converted into a travel credit.\nagent: So basically, the rebooking must be made on the same day you are cancelling the original ticket.\nuser: Sorry I'm not sure what you mean \nagent: So bottom line is, if you cancel this, the ticket will be forfeited.\nagent: Are we still connected?\nuser: hI \nuser: will i be charged for cancelling\nagent: Again, if you cancel the booking, the ticket will be forfeited as it can no longer be booked in the future.\nuser: Yes i understand that but I'm asking if i will incur a cancelling fee\nagent: Oh, I see.

And we should get a credit back for her flight. Can you confirm that as well?\nagent: I do see there will be a credit, would you allow me a few moments to verify if there is any cancellation fee?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Per southwest policy there  will be no cancellation fee. The credit will have an expiration limit of 6 months. We will need to escalate the concern to our support team at this time to split the booking then cancel for Abbey, so as not to interrupt your flights. Can you hold for a few moments while we do that?\nuser: Thanks for confirming, Jordan. Yes, I can wait\nagent: thank you!\nagent: I'm Still working on this and Appreciate your patience\nuser: Okay thanks\nagent: you're welcome\nagent: Hi Mitchell?\nuser: Hello\nagent: We are ready to go ahead with the cancellation, but one of the rules with southwest basic fare is that when you cancel, any rebooking will need to be with a higher fare , and cannot be another basic fare, can we proceed with the change?\nuser: We aren't rebooking though. Just cancelling Abbey's flight. Do you mean we would have to use the flight credit on a higher fare in the future? Or do you mean that I am being rebooked and will have to pay a higher fare for this flight?\nagent: you will need to use the flight credit for Abbey to rebook a higher fare in the future or risk losing the credit\nagent: your flight is protected\nuser: As long as my flight is protected and we are getting a credit back for Abbey then you are good to proceed. \nuser: That seems like a ridiculous rule on their part, though lol\nagent: Yes, sorry, I do see it has changed from the previous way of charging a cancellation fee. and I understand it is inconvenient ,we will keep your flight and upload Abbey's flight credit to her navan personal travel account after 5 business days\nagent: The cancellation is complete. Can I help you with anything else today?\nuser: Thanks. Even though the credit will be uploaded to Abbey's Navan account, would we be able to use it to book directly with Southwest, if need be? For instance, we recently booked with them directly due to a sale that did not appear on Navan. If that happens again can we use her flight credit outside of Navan?\nagent: You can make that request with Southwest directly , and provide the credit number that gets uploaded to the profile\nuser: Understood. Thanks for your help, Jordan\nagent: of course, can I help with something else today?\nuser: Not today, thanks.\nagent: It has been a pleasure assisting you today.

    "agent_part_body": "user: Thanks \nuser: Basically I just want to confirm there should only be 2 passengers for the SNA&gt;CHS trip, Andrea Sugino and myself Rachel Eason. The previous passenger Aaron Smith should have been canceled. Can you assist?\nagent: I see you are chatting in about a booking for Aaron Smith?\nuser: Correct\nagent: I do see that you have current flight bookings for yourself, Aaron, and Andrea. Aaron's booking was made on March 27th and has not been amended, or canceled. It is currently active.\nuser: I chatted with someone about this a couple weeks ago when I re-booked for Andrea Sugino. I need Aaron Smith's booking to be canceled. Can you please cancel and confirm?\nuser: Credit back to the company account is fine\nagent: I have looked at Aaron's booking and see it is non-refundable, so if you cancel it, it will be issued as a flight credit for the original traveler, Aaron Smith. American Airlines tickets and credits are not transferable and can only be used by the originally ticketed person.\nuser: Even if the booking was paid for by a company card it can not be credited back to original payment?\nagent: I do see you chatted in a couple weeks ago about a booking for yourself KCSNTY, which was cancelled on April 21st.\nagent: Unfortunately, that is correct. American Airlines is very strict with their ticketing. Well, to be fair most of the airlines our there have the same ticketing policy with a few exceptions.\nuser: So it can't even be used as a credit through the Navan account and can only be returned to the passenger? \nuser: This passenger is not with the company and should not be issued the credit, There's no way around it? \nagent: It is not something that we can change or work around I am afraid. When a flight credit is issued, its basically just that same ticket as a credit (including ticket number, name, date of birth, etc) and when creating a new flight (to use the credit on) all of those elements have to match.\nagent: Its normally not an issue with business travelers as they tend to travel a bunch. I find that when companies are booking flights for new hires, or interview candidates, I recommend doing refundable tickets just for this very example.\nagent: Shall I go ahead and cancel that booking, CHVDEK, for Aaron?\nuser: If I keep the ticket and the passenger does not fly do they still get a credit refunded?\nagent: So if we leave it as is, the ticket will be marked as a no-show by the airline when they do not show up on the 4th for their flight. At that point AA will mark the ticket as suspended and it will have no value after that.\nuser: Okay let's just keep it as is \nagent: No worries, I will leave it as it. It can be cancelled basically anytime prior to flight, so if you decide you want to go ahead and cancel I would recommend doing it a couple hours before departure at the latest.\nuser: thank you\nagent: My pleasure, sorry for the strict ticketing information. For now, is there anything else I can look into for you?\nuser: That's all, thank you!\nagent: It was a pleasure assisting you today. If any other questions arise, please feel free to contact us at any time, we are here 24/7 to help.

One moment, please.\nagent: Thank you for contacting Navan, my name is Hugo and i will be happy to assist you today. 😃 Hope you are doing well !",
    "agent_part_body": "agent: Hi Céline\nagent: allow me a moment to have a look at your request\nuser: Hi Hugo, can you please help I cannot change/cancel a flight for pierre.baque@neuralconcept.com it seems that all flights are \"together\" which is a big deal: I have to cancel the ICN-NRT one on May 31\nagent: You wish to cancel the JAL 5202 from ICN to NRT on the 31st, correct ?\nagent: only.. this flight and not the whole trip...got it\nuser: yes. How come they all appear as 1 when trying to cancel/change?\nagent: System does recognize this as a all trip.. we have to make this change/cancelation manually...\nagent: instead of a whole trip, this is in fact issued in 3 different tickets, that makes a lot easier to make such changes\nuser: Oh, ok I see. So can you please do it for me? I could do it without any problem for tom.becker@neuralconcept.com, can you please clarify for next time if I did something wrong while booking for pierre baqué?\nagent: so let's cancel the ICN to NRT as you wish\nuser: OK, but for Tom becker it seems that all flights have 1 ticket, which seems lots easier if you need to cancel/make changes, no?\nagent: You did good Celine, it is just the way the automation works... dont worry\nuser: OK....\nagent: That's what we are here for :)\nuser: great, thanks!\nagent: Ok Celine, that flight segment will be canceled as requested and sent for refund department.\nagent: it will reflect in the booking in the next few minutes\nagent: Is there anything else i could help you with today?\nuser: OK thanks! yes please, can you please just clarify why for tom.becker@neuralconcept.com all flights (for same travel) appear separate, as for pierre.baque@neuralconcept.com not? For Pierre I picked \"multi-city\", maybe Tom Becker did book each flight separately? just want to making sure all is done properly in the future...\nagent: So in the tom.becker@neuralconcept.com  case, there were several booking numbers, one per each flight. \nThis is way you are able to cancel each one without any problem.\nagent: In his profile you can see 5 or 6 bookings for the same trip, on the other hand only 1 booking with several flights is there for Pierre.\nagent: When it comes to multi-city bookings the option to have them all in 1 booking number is best for organizational purposes, since you have the same booking ID for all flights, and in some cases, you can combine all airlines and tends to be cheaper.\nagent: On the other hand, if the multi-city needs adjusting or changes, the best way is to have it done in multiple flights, this way..you will ensure that you can always take care of the needed flight, one by one.\nuser: yes, I did the booking for Pierre, but I think Tom is more used to travel (and use Navan): that's why I want to making sure I process the right way\nagent: Céline, you did everything well done and correct ! dont worry :)\n\nTom, I would say knows his way around travels... it is far more easy to manage flight by flight, but requires more organization on his own trips..luckily Navan does that for him !\nuser: OK! and can I ask another question regarding the same trip? I have to make a change for accommodation I booked in SFO for both of them (Marriott)- I only selected changeable/cancelable rates- but it seems that I have to make a new booking, before it can be changed, which is weird because I only need to cancel the 2 first nights, but keep the 3 last ones. How to proceed please?\nuser: I you can do it for me in 1 click instead I have to rebook the same hotel it would be much easier I think. So to keep for both Pierre and Tom the same booking but from 14-17 only\nagent: Sure, Céline, the way the system works is looking for a new availability for the selected dates, meaning once you have established that you do have the needed nights/dates, the system will cancel the previous booking and arrange a new one. \nIt will never edit/update the main booking.\nagent: Let me have a look at it, one moment please\nuser: Thank you\nagent: Céline, thank you for your time.\nagent: in fact as mentioned, it will be as explained.. we need to make a new availability and then the system will confirm the new booking and cancel the original one\nuser: which means that I have to do it twice: once for Pierre and once for Tom: isn't there a simpler way to do it?\nagent: It will generate a new booking instead of using the \"old\" one to avoid confusion.\nIf the new dates are not showing, means hotel may be sold out for that period or could not accommodate the change.\n\nPlease also note there are a few fare options available and some of them do come from 3rd party providers\nagent: I can have that changed for you, I just need to reach the provider, and have the new dates done for both of the guests.\nuser: yes please Hugo, so we need only to change the current booking to 14-17 mai (meaning cancel the 2 first nights)\nuser: *may\nagent: For sure Céline, let me have a few minutes to reach the provider, and have them change both rooms, for 14-17MAY\nuser: thanks!\nagent: :) anytime\nagent: Working with  provider and hotel to keep same room type\nagent: please hold with me Céline\nagent: thank you\nuser: OK\nagent: The hotel as approved the change of dates to 14-17 MAY as requested, on same room type, for both guests.\nAnd a refund of the 2 first nights was already requested for your convenience.\nagent: Is there anything else i could help you with today?\nuser: Great, thanks a lot! Will it be automatically updated here in Navan shortly?\nuser: I think that's it for now. So you confirm the cancelating for the flights in Asia and those 2 nights in SFO?\nuser: I might contact you again re.this trip as we have lots of changes I'm afraid\nagent: Recap:\nWe have cancel the flight from ICN to NRT for Pierre Baque\n+\nagent: Modified San Francisco Marriott for both Pierre and Thomas 14-17 MAY , and a refund was initiated for both\nagent: same room type\nagent: Please do so Céline\nuser: all good then! Yes, I canceled myself the flight for Tom\nuser: Thanks a lot!\nagent: Céline, it was my pleasure.\nagent: It was a pleasure assisting you today.

You seem to be chatting about cancelling Brian's outbound flight and keep the return, right?\nuser: Yes that is correct. When I went to do this on my own, the only option I saw was to cancel both ways. Would he get a credit for the cancelled outbound flight?\nagent: Let me go ahead and check on that. I am already looking for an option. Please give me a few minutes to check the policy.\nuser: Thanks\nagent: Your most welcome, Mitchell. Kindly give me a few minutes to check this.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, upon checking with United Airlines policy, cancelling the outbound flight and keeping the return is a proces of change. Because a new ticket needs to be issued for the return flight as the ticket that Brian have is currently roundtrip.\nagent: Upon checking there's actually no change fee for changing your flight, however, there will be also no fee in cancelling the outbound now. How would you like to proceed on this?\nuser: Do you mean we need to cancel the roundtrip flight and rebook just the return flight but we can do so for free?\nagent: Yes, that's right.\nuser: Okay. Would you be able to help with that?\nagent: Yes, of course. Do you wish to proceed in cancelling and keeping the return flight?\nuser: Yes please\nagent: Perfect! Thank you for that. Kindly stay connected and allow me 2-3 minutes to complete this before we end the chat. Okay?\nagent: Thank you so much for waiting, Mitchell. I managed to change the flight of Brian. The new flight is departing May 20 from SNA to COS with 1 hour and 35 minutes layover.\nagent: I also choose a seat for his flight leaving from SNA to DEN. Apparently, there's no window seat that is free on the flight from DEN to COS, but the airline will provide a seat once checked in.\nagent: Will there be anything else that I can assist you with?\nuser: Thank you for dong that! And these updates will show up in the Navan trip for Brian to see?\nagent: Yes, you can try checking that through his Navan profile, as the flight has already been updated.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, I also noticed that Brian does have a hotel booking, however upon checking here, the hotel rooms are non-refundable. Any changes that you may want to check will be cancelling this, and rebooking a new one.\nagent: Hi Mitchell, is there anything else you need assistance with?\nuser: No that is all. Thank you for your hlep!\nagent: Thank you for choosing Navan, and have a safe trip! By the way, there will be a short survey at the end of this interaction about the service that I provided.

I would normally recommend you log in as the traveler and then cancel it that way.  But just one moment please.\nuser: we don't have the permission to log in as the guests\nagent: I checked I'm not seeing a way but I don't see David in the Event for July 22nd - 24th.  In either case, just one moment while I work on canceling this for you.\nuser: I see him. He is the first guest listed in the participant details\nuser: And booking id CXWSTL\nagent: Oh I found him, do you have the View option on there?\nuser: In my manager dashboard I cannot see him because it only lists 10 flights and there are more\nuser: Ok. I found the view option but it won't let me cancel\nagent: Oh okay that's what i wanted to check\nagent: Okay just one moment please.\nagent: Hope, to cancel the booking there will be a residual credit for David in the amount of $1,197.90.  Is that okay to cancel and process for you?\nuser: Yes. Will the credit go back to HNI or just to the guests account?\nagent: The credit stays with the traveler for him to use on a future United flight.\nuser: Per our terms with Navan, you should be working with the airline for the credit to be coming back to the company (us) not to go to the traveler. \nagent: I can check to see if your company has an agreement with United Airlines and if they do.  You might be allowed to process a name change on that credit, when your ready to use it.\nuser: Please because the guests should not be getting the credits, HNI should be\nagent: Just one moment.\nagent: Hope in checking with United they do not have a corporate account listed for your company.  So the credit would remain with the traveler for him to use.  Shall I proceed with the cancellation in either case?\nuser: Either way yes cancel but I will be escalating the matter with our team. We are not just giving flights away to people. \nagent: I’ll go ahead and process the cancellation as requested.\n\nRegarding the corporate ID, I provided the one currently listed on your account, as requested by United. If you discover that United provided different information, or if there is an additional corporate ID not reflected on your account, please let us know. We’ll be happy to check whether that secondary number has the capability to make name changes for you.\nuser: Thank you\nagent: Okay hope booking id CXWSTL has been canceled, is there anything else I can assist with at this time?\nuser: No thank you\nagent: Okay great, of course anytime!

Just need to confirm we are only canceling the YYZ to LAS and the LAS to YYZ (return) will not be canceled \nagent: Ahh I see you are trying to cancel just the departure, unfortunately you aren't able to just cancel and outbound and keep a return\nagent: The whole flight would be canceled and then would need to rebook the return.\nuser: Ah bummer... Understood. Would you be able to assist in this? \nagent: Yes definitely! Let me double check the return flight before we cancel anything\nuser: Thank you!\nagent: It does look like business is available on the same flights\nuser: Great, thanks for checking this Michelle!\nagent: I would recommend Jaime save their credit for a flight that is the same value or higher to get the full use out of it\nagent: and pay for this one outright\nagent: What would you like to do credit wise?\nuser: Since we booked this on the corporate card, I think we'd like to do a refund and rebook under the same card if I'm understanding correctly?\nagent: Unfortunately there is no refund, there would just be a credit with the airline for canceling the current flights\nagent: I was just recommending those be save to book in the future on a more expensive flight so they don't lose the value\nagent: As credits are one ticket for one ticket vs like a gift card deduction unfortunately\nuser: Ahh hmm. How do you suggest approaching this? I presume these credits will be issued to Jaime personally? As opposed to the company ?\nagent: They will be under Jamie's name, but can only be used through us for busines travel, unless approval from a manager or travel admin\nuser: So another employee would be able to utilize these credits for there travel with approval from a manager?\nuser: And if we proceed with this, are we able to use these credits for the LAS &gt; YYZ\nagent: Tickets are not transferrable to another person unless your company has a corporate agreement directly with an airline\nagent: It would stay under Jaime for them to book business travel within the experation date\nagent: expiration*\nuser: Just want to ensure I'm following correctly.\nuser: option A is to cancel this trip for 1,914.44 in airline credits, rebook the return for ~$1,500, and Jamie will have ~$400 credits with Air CA, only available through navan \nagent: Yes if we cancel, they will have a credit that can be used for business travel in the future with Air Canada\nagent: No sorry they would forfeit the rest\nagent: That is why I was advising to save the credits for the future to use the full value\nagent: One ticket per one ticket exchange with a credit - not like a gift card with a remainder\nagent: so we advise to wait until you have a flight 1914.44 or higher to use your full credit\nuser: Ahh gotcha. So if we leave things as is, we loose $250 in value after consideration for the $143 in charges\nagent: Yes that correct\nuser: Let me consult my team quickly apologies \nagent: No problem at all!\nagent: Happy to hang on the line\nuser: Thank you so much!\nagent: No trouble at all!\nuser: Just one moment, working through it\nagent: No problem, take your time\nuser: still here- thanks for your patience  \nagent: Yes definitely, no problem at all\nuser: I think we'll just keep the current flight as it, it makes more sense on our end\nagent: Okay sounds good! No changes or cancellations on the current flight\nagent: Anything else I can help you with at this time?\nuser: yes!

    "agent_part_body": "user: thank you\nuser: i was being helped yesterday but i fell asleep. I think the agent split the booking which i dont really understand what it means but it was so they could try to look into just adjusting Scott's on its own\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi and the details provided. It does show the agent split the PNRs so that you and Scott were no longer on the same reservation. No cancellation was made at the time, due to a schedule change the airline made, and the consultant was never able to confirm if it was ok accept and continue. For travel the Outbound time changed to departing at 952pm arriving 640am and the return is not departing at 759pm. arriving 1144pm.\nuser: oh wow ok i didn't realize there were two changes to the timeframes. What are my options on next steps? If i don't accept do i pick new travel times and have to pay more money?   If i do accept for myself, then we're set on that piece. But if i don't accept for Scott do i get reimbursed for the first flight and need to choose a return flight? or can we just accept the return flight details?\nuser: What do you think?\nagent: At this time Kimi, there would be no reimbursement for the outbound due to the time change being 3 minutes, unless Scott cancels the whole ticket due to the return options  not being agreed to. As for the return, the options would be to accept, check for new times that work or cancellation if none are found.\nuser: so no flight credit if it's changed\nuser: ?\nagent: If the return is not feasible for travel, the airline may offer flight credit or full reimbursement if it falls into their guidelines of the schedule change, which I will gladly check if the 759pm departure is not acceptable\nuser: could you please check? I'll see if there are other flights as well\nagent: Sure Kimi allow me a moment to grab the details for you. Thank you for your patience.\nuser: Thank you\nagent: Thank you for your patience Kimi. Upon checking the guidelines, the booking would not be eligible for the refund as the delay is under 2 hours. If cancelled completely the airline will follow the fare rules of the ticket, which is non refundable.\nagent: I do see other flight time options with Alaska and Delta, as this is owned by Delta\nagent: So there can be a change made for no fee\nuser: oh great!\nuser: can we just accept the departure for both Scott and I from SFO to BOS and then make a change for free from BOS to SFO  for this flight? Or would there be an additional cost at all? \nagent: So how would you first like to move forward with your flight Kimi?\nagent: Ok Kimi, so that I have the proper details, you are looking to accept the outbound for both you and Scott, no longer cancelling Scott's trip. And looking to change the return to now depart on the 455pm departure BOS-SFO?\nuser: Yes please. I only want to change the return trip if it's truly no additional cost\nagent: Thank you for confirming Kimi. I am still here with you confirming with the airline directly, since the system is preventing me at this time to make the change at no cost. It may be due to the change from the airline being under 2 hours, so I just want to make sure it is truly not an option for you to change with no penalty.\nagent: Thank you for your continued patience and understanding\nuser: ok thanks for checking\nagent: Hey Kimi, checking in with you. Letting you know I am still here with you. :)\nuser: alrighty\nagent: Hey Kimi, you are greatly appreciated. I am still holding for assistance with the airline directly. Please let me know if you are still on the line with me?\nuser: here :)\nagent: THANK YOU!! :)\nuser: 😁😁\nagent: Hey Kimi, at this time Delta has a very long wait time, and I would hate to have you continue to wait with me. I can definitely contact you back once I have a resolution on how we can move forward. Would this be a good contact number for you +19168133358?\nuser: yes please. what number will be reaching out so i'm prepared?\nuser: what if i miss the call? can i call you back?\nagent: It usually pops up as NAVAN on the caller id.

One moment please.\nagent: Thank you for your patience. I’ve reviewed the fare rules, and changing the booking from a roundtrip to a one-way would result in a loss of $200.70. This is because the ticket was originally priced as a roundtrip, which often comes at a discounted rate. Switching to a one-way means part of that discount no longer applies, leading to the difference in cost and per United Airlines, the residual value will be lost.

Is this correct?\nuser: yes, before canceling, I would also like to confirm that I can rebook a new flight using the credit for a different passenger\nagent: Basically Kyle, tickets are non-transferrable. Converting a flight booking is just canceling the active flight segments to avoid getting tagged as no-show thus preserving the ticket value.\nagent: On this case, let me take a look first on the ticket policy for cancellation, to check if we can possibly request a refund instead.\nuser: thank you. if it's any help to understand the full process I am trying to do, Carly is no longer coming on the trip and instead I need to change to a new passenger.

However, United has a policy that we can request a refund but with a fee.\nagent: And for Carly's current ticket, the cancellation fee will be $125\nagent: As it seems that this hasn't been validated to United, how about I reach out to UA to confirm, if we can ask for a change on the passenger's name. Then call you back once confirmed?\nuser: That works\nagent: Alrighty, is this your best contact number +14158230521?\nuser: yes\nagent: Then I'll ring you once I have confirmed this with United. Then if they won't allow it, I'll have you decide if we're going to cancel it with fees.\nagent: I'll also include about transferring credit so we have another option Kyle.\nagent: Would there be anything else aside this?\nuser: no i appreciate it thank you!\nagent: It's my pleasure assisting you today. There will be a short survey at the end of this interaction. Appreciate your feedback. Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance with anything at all. Thank you for choosing Navan!",
