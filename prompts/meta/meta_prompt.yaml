v1: |
  Your task is to generate prompts for a classification task. The prompts will be used to classify flight cancellation conversations into two categories:

  1. cancel_not_for_all_passengers: Whether the user wants to cancel for fewer than all passengers
  2. partial_or_full: Whether the user wants partial cancellation (specific legs) or full cancellation

  Below are some previous prompts with their scores. Each prompt has three scores:
  - combined_score: Harmonic mean of cancel_adj_b_acc and partial_adj_b_acc (0 to {num_score_buckets}, higher is better)
  - cancel_adj_b_acc: Adjusted balanced accuracy for cancel_not_for_all_passengers classification (0 to {num_score_buckets}, higher is better)  
  - partial_adj_b_acc: Adjusted balanced accuracy for partial_or_full classification (0 to {num_score_buckets}, higher is better)
  - words: Word count (fewer is better when scores are equal)
  {prompt_score_str}{examples_str}

  Your task is to generate a new prompt that will achieve a higher score than the previous ones while being concise.

  Requirements for the new prompt:
  - It should help the AI assistant accurately classify cancel_not_for_all_passengers and partial_or_full
  - Keep it concise while maintaining accuracy

  Generate a new concise prompt that will improve classification accuracy. Output your prompt between <PROMPT> and </PROMPT> tags.

  Your task is to craft a prompt for a classification model. The model will receive a flight-cancellation conversation between a customer and an AI assistant, together with the booking details, and must predict two labels:
  1. cancel_not_for_all_passengers: yes or not
  2. partial_or_full: FULL or PARTIAL

  Below are some previous prompts with their scores. Each prompt has three scores:
  - combined_score: Harmonic mean of cancel_adj_b_acc and partial_adj_b_acc (0 to {num_score_buckets}, higher is better)
  - cancel_adj_b_acc: Adjusted balanced accuracy for cancel_not_for_all_passengers classification (0 to {num_score_buckets}, higher is better)  
  - partial_adj_b_acc: Adjusted balanced accuracy for partial_or_full classification (0 to {num_score_buckets}, higher is better)
  - words: Word count (fewer is better when scores are equal)
  {prompt_score_str}

  Here are some examples from the training data:
  {examples_str}

  Your task is to create a new, concise prompt that outperforms previous prompts in combined_score.

  Requirements for the new prompt:
  - Enable the AI assistant to correctly classify both labelsâ€”cancel_not_for_all_passengers and partial_or_full.
  - Highest priority: maximize combined_score.
  - Secondary priority: brevity. Keep the prompt under 350 words and the shorter the better if combined_score is the same.

  Output your prompt between <PROMPT> and </PROMPT> tags.
